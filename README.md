# CashSentinel
## Overview
Welcome to **CashSentinel** ‚Äì the future of ATM security! üè¶üí° This innovative project integrates **Deep Learning** into our existing Java-based **ATM Simulator System** to detect **fake banknotes in real-time**! No more counterfeit cash ruining your financial security. Say hello to **Smart ATMs** powered by AI! 
## Why This Project?
Counterfeit currency is a **serious global issue** affecting financial institutions and economies. Traditional ATMs accept deposits without verifying the authenticity of banknotes. What if **ATMs could detect fake notes before processing transactions?**  That‚Äôs exactly what **ATM-SecureML** does ‚Äì a cutting-edge integration of **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** with ATMs to **fight fraud like a pro**!

## üîó Project Integration: CashSentinel  
**CashSentinel** is a fusion of two projects, bringing together ATM functionalities and AI-powered counterfeit detection:  

1. **[Trinity Rich Bank](https://github.com/nishant-sheoran/Trinity-Rich-Bank)** ‚Äì A Java-based ATM Simulator that supports essential banking operations like account management, deposits, withdrawals, and PIN changes.  
2. **[NoteIntel](https://github.com/nishant-sheoran/NoteIntel)** ‚Äì A Deep Learning-powered Fake Banknote Detection System using an ANN to classify genuine and counterfeit currency.  

By integrating these, **CashSentinel** ensures both seamless transactions and real-time banknote authentication, enhancing security in ATM operations.

## ü§ñ Traditional ATM vs. Deep Learning Integration

| **Aspect**                | **Traditional ATM Detection**                         | **Deep Learning Integration**                               |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Detection Mechanisms**   | Optical, magnetic, size, shape, microprinting          | Multi-feature analysis using AI (texture, shape, color, etc.)|
| **Adaptability**           | Fixed sensor-based checks                             | Continuously improves and adapts from new data              |
| **Accuracy**               | Limited to predefined security features                | More accurate with the ability to detect subtle counterfeits |
| **Detection Method**       | Relies on individual sensors for specific features     | Holistic, simultaneous analysis of multiple features        |
| **Real-Time Learning**     | Static system with predefined rules                    | AI-driven, real-time learning and adaptation                |
| **User Interaction**       | Rejects fake notes or stores them for further checks   | Intelligent alerts, feedback, and improved transaction logs  |

By integrating deep learning, **ATM-SecureML** enhances the traditional ATM security systems, providing a smarter, more adaptive solution to counterfeit note detection.

## Installation & Setup
### Clone the Repository
